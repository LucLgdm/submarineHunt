# submarineHunt  
The submarine hunt is a school project that I did im 2019.  

A submarine is know to move in an area and you want to know precisely where it is. I'm order to discover it you can throw 4 sonar nat. 2 shapes are possible : a straight row or a grid pattern. You only have to input the coordinates of 2 of the sonar.  
When the submarine goes near a sonar, this one turn to red until the submarine is far enough away. 

The base element is a brick (brique.h), with a brick we can build a sonar (bouee.h) and the submarine (sousmarin.h).
